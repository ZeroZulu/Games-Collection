# 🎮 AI Games Collection — Turning Data Science into Play

> A curated collection of mini-projects that blend **AI reasoning**, **algorithmic optimization**, and **data-driven logic** — each reimagined as a playable game.

Built to demonstrate **analytical thinking through interactivity**, this repository showcases how a Data Analyst / Data Scientist can:
- Design structured, testable decision systems,
- Visualize algorithmic reasoning,
- And communicate complex models through intuitive interfaces.
